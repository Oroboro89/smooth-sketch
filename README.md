# Enhanced Sketch SpriteKit
> Enables realistic freehand drawing on SpriteKit Games.

## Introduction:
Freehand drawing is surprisingly difficult to achieve properly on iOS SpriteKit. That's because SKShapeNode is currently plagued with memory leaking bugs, meaning your overall game performance will increasingly degrade as the user continues drawing, until their device crashes.

This enhanced sketch framework aims to solve the performance issues with freehand drawing and provide memory efficient and realistic drawing to game developers.

I will be writing proper documentation for this framework later on, to explain the problem of freehand drawing and demonstrate my work-around.
